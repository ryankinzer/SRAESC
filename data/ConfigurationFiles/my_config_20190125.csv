The site was initially installed with two antennas in the ladder; a third antenna was added in June 2018 to monitor all fish handled in the work room at the trap. The antennas are currently driven by Biomark IS1001s and controlled by a Biomark IS1001-MC. The equipment is powered by a Hybrid- TEG (model 5220 and 1kw solar).

The antenna configuration is a single line of fifteen antennas on the upstream sill of the Obemeyer Weir, each approximately twenty feet in length (efficiency estimates are not possible without direct tag-testing). The antennas are designed to detect fish as the water is beginning to accelerate off the spillway.  Antennas are ferrite shielded to prevent interference from the weir and rebar.

Both rows of antennas consist of 3, 25X30 HDPE flat plates constructed by Yakama Nation spanning the entire channel under most flow conditions.  The antennas are secured to the substrate using MR-4 anchors and a combination of NRS and ratchet straps. The site was installed in July 2018 by WDFW and Yakama Nation staff and started collecting data on 10/15/2018 at 13:15.","Instream Remote Detection System","539.284.000",823,47.174326,-120.8364

Each row consists of six 20-foot PVC antennas, installed in flat-plate configuration.  Each antenna is powered by a Biomark IS1001 (ACN) and the ACNs are connected to a Biomark IS1001-MC (MTS).  The antennas were built and installed by WDFW.  The site is powered by a thermoelectric generator.  LWE has remote communication abilities provided by a cellular modem and Campbell Scientific CR1000 datalogger.  A submersible pressure transducer and temperature probe sensors are also installed to provide environmental condition data collection.","Instream Remote Detection System","754.003",757,47.46489257,-120.3501623

The electronics enclosure and battery box are located on the river right bank on the back side of a storage shed used by the camp host at Chinook Bay Campground.The site consists of four 20ft HDPE antennas, located in a single string across the river.  The antennas are constructed of fusion welded 4 inch HDPE pipe. Each antenna is driven by a Biomark IS1001 reader located in a submersible canister attached to the antenna. The readers are controlled by a Biomark IS1001-MC located in an enclosure on the shore.   The antennas are anchored to the streambed with a through-strut method using DB-88 earth anchors attached to stainless steel threaded rod. The anchors are driven to a depth of 20-30 inches into the river bed. The IS1001 readers are connected to the IS1001-MC via Biomark CAN Bus cable. All cables are covered by flexible non-metallic conduit.  Power for the system is supplied by six 12V 115Ah batteries, these batteries are run in series-parallel to create 24V to power the IS1001-MC and provide approximately 7 days of runtime.The required permits are still pending to install the complete enclosure and connect the system to AC power via an Isolation Transformer and disconnect switch.

The array includes ISEMP standard site monitoring equipment including: air and water temperature probes, and a water pressure transducer to monitor stream level. Electrical power is provided by a battery switcher with power supplied from the electrical power grid. Remote communication is provided by a cellular phone modem. Data collection began in November 2012.","Instream Remote Detection System","522.303.460",1285,44.88976345,-113.9641445
