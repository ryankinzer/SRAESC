Initial configuration of the site included 3-20ft, Biomark Lite antennas, each spanning the wetted width of the creek. Antenna 1 is upstream, 2 middle, and 3 is the downstream antenna. Antennas 2 and 3 were damaged February 2016 and were replaced in February 2017 with 24 x 8 ft quadrilaterlas constructed with 1 inch PEX. Ten inch posts were used on the bottom of the creek to create a backbone for the antennas.  The posts are secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors.  The sides of the antennas are secured using anchors on an exposed bank, clamps on trees and one t-post for antenna 3.  Antennas 2 and 3 have a complete field of detection with 24 inches of read range off the coil.  Each antenna is connected to a submersible IS1001 antenna control node which are anchored to the bank.

The site had MUX with 2 rows of 3-20’ schedule 80 PVC antennas and used solar panels to generate power.  After an historic flow event in the fall of 2015 the decision was made to relocate the site to a more stable location and upgrade the equipment with more durable HDPE antennas and IS1001 readers and controller.  In October of 2018, the site was relocated 200’ below Lambert bridge, 5 miles east of Cle Elum Washington (47.174326, -120.836400).  The IS1001 MTS is powered by a 200 Ah 24V battery bank charged with a 24V, 8A Interacter charger which is connected to grid power.  There are two CAN bus trunk lines ~60’ long that are connected to the upper and lower rows of ACNs.  The submersible enclosures for the IS1001s were constructed by Yakama Nation Fisheries and consist of schedule 40 PVC with various fittings.  The submersibles were pressure tested to ensure a water tight enclosure.  They are located 8’ below each antenna and are daisy chained together.  Hydrovolt plugs are located between each submersible for the CAN bus cabling  and from submersible to antenna allowing each component to detatch under extreme flow conditions.  The CAN bus cabling is routed in a straight line 8’ below each row of antennas and is secured to 3/8” stainless steel cable using zip ties.  The stainless steel cable is secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors, ~10’ apart.  Both rows of antennas consist of 3, 25’X30” HDPE flat plates constructed by Yakama Nation spanning the entire channel under most flow conditions.  The antennas are secured to the substrate using MR-4 anchors and a combination of NRS and ratchet straps.

TWX,NA,INT,Estuary Towed Array (Exp.),"The TWX site is located in the upper Columbia River estuary, between Eagle Cliff (rkm 84) and the west end of Puget Island (rkm 66). This site is sampled annually by NOAA Fisheries during the spring and summer outmigration of juvenile salmonids. There are currently three detection systems in use. The trawl, operated since 1995, is a surface pair-trawl with a matrix of six rectangular antennas fitted into the cod end of the net. The matrix is configured with three parallel antennas in front and three in the rear, forming a corridor that allows fish to pass through while being detected by the antennas. The flexible antenna system was developed in 2015 and is a modular array, consisting of up to twelve rectangular antennas, connected side-by-side in a vertical orientation. These are constructed of manufactured antenna cable and are also towed between two vessels. These two systems operate 3-7 days per week from mid March to mid June. The PIT tag detection barge is an autonomous floating platform supporting vertical antennas. The current system (designed and fabricated by West Fork Environmental, holder of 3 patents on vertical antenna arrays) has 12 FINS, each housing a coil that couples to its neighboring FIN. In this configuration the system is comprised of 6 nodes that are multiplexed through a controller for continuous interrogation of a 50-foot-wide by 8-foot-deep section of the river. The barge is anchored fore and aft in approximately 30 feet of water. West Fork is collaborating with NOAA Fisheries in an evaluation of the vertical floating array to detect passing PIT tagged salmonid smolts. The barge is being tested for the first time at this site during May and June 2018.",Trawl Net,075,75,46.142688,-123.335061,GRA.Below_GRA.Below_GRA_Other.TWX,Below_GRA,Below_GRA_Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
